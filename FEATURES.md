# To-Do App Feature Plan

## Purpose
This app is a simple to-do list manager that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. It helps users keep track of their daily tasks efficiently.

## Core Features

### 1. Task Management
- **Create Task:**  
  - *User Story:* As a user, I want to create a new task so I can keep track of my to-dos.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* The user can enter a title, description, due date, and priority. The new task appears in the task list.

- **List Tasks:**  
  - *User Story:* As a user, I want to view all my tasks so that I know what needs to be done.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* All tasks are displayed in a responsive list that updates dynamically.

- **Update Task:**  
  - *User Story:* As a user, I want to update my tasks so I can reflect any changes.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* The user can modify task details and the changes are saved and reflected immediately.

- **Delete Task:**  
  - *User Story:* As a user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer needed.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* The user can remove tasks from the list, and the task is no longer visible.

- **Mark as Completed:**  
  - *User Story:* As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed so I know which tasks are done.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* The user can toggle the completion status, and completed tasks are visually differentiated.

### 2. User Interface (UI)
- **Design a Clean UI:**  
  - *User Story:* As a user, I want a simple and attractive interface so that managing my tasks is easy.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* The UI is responsive and intuitive, using a CSS framework (like Bootstrap) for a consistent look and feel.

### 3. User Authentication
- **User Registration/Login/Logout:**  
  - *User Story (Registration):* As a new user, I want to register an account so I can have my personal to-do list.
  - *User Story (Login):* As a returning user, I want to log in so I can access my tasks securely.
  - *Acceptance Criteria:* Users can register, login, and logout. Each user sees only their tasks.

## Prioritization
For the initial version, focus on Task Management and the basic UI. User Authentication can be added later if time permits.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement filtering and sorting of tasks.
- Add task notifications or reminders.
- Enhance the UI with animations or additional interactive elements.
